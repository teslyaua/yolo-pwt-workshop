`playwright` is the most recent Test Automation toolâ€‹â€‹ in the software testingâ€‹â€‹ industry. It isâ€‹â€‹ developed andâ€‹â€‹ supported by Microsoftâ€‹â€‹ and is one of the best tools for UI and API testing.â€‹â€‹ Playwrightâ€‹â€‹ does not require any complicated configuration. Everything like â€“â€‹â€‹ Typescript,â€‹â€‹ assertion library, Test runnerâ€‹â€‹ etc are packedâ€‹â€‹ by defaultâ€‹â€‹ inside playwright.

## The goal

This workshop teaches you Playwright Test (PWT) essentials to setup reliable and maintainable end-to-end testing.

Supportive materials and tasks are all included in the `/lessons` directory. The lessons are built on top of each other and are hands-on â€” **work through them at your own pace**. I'll answer questions on the way and might do the exercises, too.

To follow along, all the examples will test [lab-based user backoffice](http://p-lab_user-admin.p.testenv.io/users).

**But feel free to test and implement functionality on other websites.**

> **Note** You can also find running examples and solutions for each lesson under `/solutions`.

## Action plan

Work through the materials at your own pace. I'll cover lessons every now and then live and will answer questions on the way. Have fun!
