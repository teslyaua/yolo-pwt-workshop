# Record your first PWT test

> Get a start with `recording`.

Playwright provides invaluable "test recording" functionality called `codegen`.

## Record tests via the `playwright` command

Kick off a new `codegen` session with `npx playwright codegen`.

```bash
 npx playwright codegen http://t2-lab_user-admin.t2.testenv.io/
```

Record the login process for your user

Copy and paste into your new test file (`./tests/example.spec.js`) and rename it to `./tests/login.spec.js`

## Playwright UI Mode

UI Mode let's you explore, run and debug tests with a time travel experience complete with watch mode. All test files are loaded into the testing sidebar where you can expand each file and describe block to individually run, view, watch and debug each test.

`Running tests in UI Mode`

```bash
npx playwright test --ui
```

## Playwright VS Code extension

Most of Playwright's CLI functionality is also available via [the official VS Code extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-playwright.playwright).

Install this extention to your VS Code.

### Debugging in VS Code

In some areas, the VS Code extension is more powerful than the terminal because it allows you to inspect variables, set break points and run a single test by clicking a button.

### Assertions in the test

Add any `expect` to the test that `Customers` text is visible

```typescript
await expect(
  page.getByText("Customers").nth(1),
  "Customers label should be visible"
).toBeVisible();
```
